### Quick explaination of the process
1. __Start your mapping__ via UI or [programatically](comp_map_data_uploader.md#startstop-uploading-datas)
2. __Collect the datas__ by walking around (make sure you consider the __uploaded datas__ and not the locally captured data). You can create objects along your mapping to create "reference positions".
3. __Train your map__ once you have enough datas **uploaded** via UI or [programatically](comp_map_data_uploader.md#run-generation-new-map)
4. [__Relocate__](#how-to-relocate) after receiving the email notification by selecting your map name
5. [__Update__ (Optional)](update_instructions.md) via UI or [programatically](comp_map_data_uploader.md#run-update-existing-map)
