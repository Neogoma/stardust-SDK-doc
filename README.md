## About
The Stardust SDK is Neogoma's solution for visual positioning indoors and outdoors.

We have a [repository](https://github.com/Neogoma/stardust-SDK) that you can use as an example of how to use the Stardust SDK for Mapping/Relocation.


A video showing the SDK capabilities is available on [our youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zwqa6DMVCQ&feature=emb_logo).
