## Running the mapping 
- You first need to make sure that your phone **SLAM** is stable enough to send proper datas to the server.
- Then when you start mapping a place you need to make sure that you walk **at a normal pace**.


## How does it work
Unlike previous versions our mapping strategy is focused on collecting good quality data rather than a maximum of datas.
As a result the frames will be captured when we detect you moved in a significant way rather than at regular intervals.

## Examples
### Good mapping example
The following video is a simple example of **GOOD MAPPING**.

[Good mapping](_videos/good_mapping.mp4  ':include :type=video')

The user walk slowly and turns the camera slowly during rotations. 

### Bad mapping example
The following video is a simple example of **BAD MAPPING**


**What is wrong ?**
1. The user turned the camera fast so some frames will be low quality
2. The user was running while mapping which made frame inconsistent in quality
3. Because of the fast movements, maybe the SLAM datas of the phones are also

[Bad mapping](_videos/bad_mapping.mp4 ':include :type=video')
